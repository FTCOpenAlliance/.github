# Welcome to The Open Alliance!
The Open Alliance presents an easy way for open, data-driven collaboration between teams participating in FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition. This GitHub Organization holds the various open-source projects maintained by the Open Alliance (and contributors from the FIRST community) designed to facilitate sharing, communication, and collaboration among all FIRST teams.

## Open Alliance Principles
All Open Alliance teams should strive to follow the following principles to foster a collaborative community!
- Open Alliance teams do not keep secrets.
- Open Alliance teams do their best to provide frequent updates throughout the year.
- Open Alliance teams use Chief Delphi to post updates and answer questions. They are also encouraged to explore other mediums.
- Open Alliance teams provide open code and/or CAD.
- Open Alliance teams include the bad and the good.
- Open Alliance teams join to help all teams, not just other Open Alliance teams.

## Joining the Alliance
The Open Alliance is always welcoming new teams! To register for the Alliance, visit [the registration form](https://theopenalliance.org/join), select your program, and enter your team info, links, and statistics. New teams should first create a build thread on Chief Delphi, as well as a code repository on GitHub (or a similar service) and a publicly accessibly CAD document on Onshape or another web-based CAD platform. Teams may also add links to a website and an album of photos/videos. You may edit your team's profile at any time through this same form. Simply select your program and enter your team number, then press the Autofill button to fetch your current data. After making changes to this info, press the submit button, and your profile will be updated.

## What do we collect?
The Open Alliance will host a public online CAD, a Git repository, and a Chief Delphi build thread. We may also host images or videos later on. In addition, we will also ask for robot statistics such as drivetrain type and programming language. This data will be displayed on your profile, and will be featured on a program-wide data visualiser and our public API. Finally, we ask all teams to respond to long-form questions as reflections of their team's progress and unique features, which can be answered later into a given season if preferred.

## Contributing
The Open Alliance team is committed to fostering a sustainable and long-lasting program, and that's only possible with the help of the community. If you're an avid developer, feel free to reach out to us and join the team. You may also contribute to any of our open-source repositories by submitting issues and pull requests. Be on the lookout for issues opened by the Open Alliance team!
