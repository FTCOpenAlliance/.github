# Welcome to FTC Open Alliance
Inspired by The Open Alliance for FRC, FTC Open Alliance presents an easy way for open, data-driven collaboration between FIRST Tech Challenge Teams. This GitHub Organization holds the various open-source projects created by FTCOA and contributors from FTCOA teams designed to facilitate sharing, communication, and collaboration throughout an FTC season.

## FTCOA Protocol and Principles
The FTC Open Alliance follows the same principles as FTC Open Alliance. They are listed below.
- Open Alliance teams do not keep secrets.
- Open Alliance teams do their best to provide frequent updates throughout the year.
- Open Alliance teams use Chief Delphi to post updates and answer questions. They are also encouraged to explore other mediums.
- Open Alliance teams provide open code and/or CAD.
- Open Alliance teams include the bad and the good.
- Open Alliance teams join to help all teams, not just other Open Alliance teams.

## Joining the Alliance
FTC Open Alliance is currently in its beta testing year, so we are only accepting members who we have personally invited. After this initial testing period, we will open FTCOA to all teams, so that any team can join and contribute their Code, CAD, and Build Thread. Once FTCOA starts public admission, teams will be able to submit these through a form hosted on the FTCOA website at [FTCOpenAlliance.org](FTCOpenAlliance.org).

## What do we collect?

FTCOA will follow the standard of The Open Alliance (FRC) in its data collection. We will ask for a publicly hosted online CAD, a Github repository, and a Chief Delphi build thread. We may also host images or videos later on. In addition to the Open Alliance standard, we will also ask for robot statistics such as drivetrain type, programming language, and hardware type. This data will be displayed on your profile, and could be used in features such as a site-wide data visualiser or automated pit-scouting API.

## Contributing

For the first year of FTCOA, we will not be accepting external contributions to our codebase while we ensure that the backbone of the operation is well-developed. After the first pilot year, we will begin accepting contributions through GitHub. If you would like to make a contribution, we should soon have a detailed list of desired features, present bugs, and other tasks, any of which you could assign yourself to and work on through a fork of the corresponding repository. After you integrate the feature or eliminate the issue, you must create a pull request with a detailed title and description in order to have your contribution reviewed and merged into our codebase by an FTC Open Alliance administrator.
